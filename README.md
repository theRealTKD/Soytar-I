# Soytar-I ‚Äì A Balatro Mod

**Soytar-I** is a Balatro mod that adds **5 new Jokers** with a vanilla-balanced design philosophy. Each Joker introduces fresh gameplay mechanics without disrupting the game's overall balance.

## üé≠ Included Jokers

- **Old Photo**  
  Gain Xmult for every hand played consecutively without repeating the previous poker hand.

- **Self-Portrait**  
  Boosts the XMult of scored face cards. Only obtainable after photograph joker is bought.
